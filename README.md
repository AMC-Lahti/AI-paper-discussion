PHYMPGN: PHYSICS-ENCODED MESSAGE PASSING GRAPH NETWORK FOR SPATIOTEMPORAL PDE SYSTEMS
- paper: https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2410.01337
- For PDE/ODE system, to find y(t1) = G(y(t0)), y(t1) = y(t0) + intergal of y'(t) between t0 and t1. y'(t) is a function of system state of time t, i.e, y'(t) = F(y(t)).
- Numerical methods (Runge-Kutta) to approximate integral, so we only need to find y'(t) = F(y(t)), instead of find y(t1) = G(y(t0)).
